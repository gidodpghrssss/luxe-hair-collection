        Q: What is the difference between Regular Lace and HD Lace?

        Q: How long does the hair last?

        A: Yes, our hair can be colored. We recommend using a professional stylist for best results. Lighter colors may require multiple processing sessions.
        
        Q: What density should I choose?
        A: 130% density provides a natural look, 150-180% offers fuller volume, and 200%+ provides the most dramatic volume. For first-time wig wearers, we recommend 150% density.

        ## Hair Care and Maintenance

        # Hair Care Instructions

        ## Daily Maintenance

        ### Wigs
        1. Gently detangle your wig daily using a wide-tooth comb or wig brush, starting from the ends and working your way up.
        2. Apply a small amount of leave-in conditioner or lightweight hair oil to the ends if the hair feels dry.
        3. If wearing daily, secure your wig properly with wig clips, combs, or adhesive to prevent shifting.
        4. Remove your wig before sleeping and store it properly on a wig stand.
        5. For lace front or full lace wigs, clean any adhesive residue from the lace with alcohol-free cleanser.

        ### Extensions
        1. Brush extensions 2-3 times daily with a loop brush or extension-specific brush to prevent tangling.
        2. Tie hair in a loose braid or ponytail before sleeping to prevent tangling.
        3. Use a silk or satin pillowcase to reduce friction and breakage.
        4. Apply leave-in conditioner to ends as needed to maintain moisture.
        5. Keep heat styling to a minimum to extend the life of the extensions.

        ## Washing Instructions

        ### Wigs
        1. Frequency: Wash every 7-10 wears or when product buildup becomes visible.
        2. Pre-wash: Gently detangle with a wide-tooth comb before washing.
        3. Washing: Use lukewarm water and sulfate-free shampoo. Apply shampoo in a downward motion, never rubbing or scrubbing.
        4. Conditioning: Apply conditioner from mid-lengths to ends, avoiding the roots/knots. Leave on for 5-10 minutes.
        5. Rinse thoroughly with cool water to seal the cuticle.
        6. Blot excess water with a microfiber towel. Never wring or twist.
        7. Air dry on a wig stand away from direct heat or sunlight.

        ### Extensions
        1. Frequency: Wash clip-ins every 15-20 wears; wash tape-ins, sew-ins, and other semi-permanent extensions every 7-10 days.
        2. Pre-wash: Gently detangle with a loop brush or wide-tooth comb.
        3. Washing: Hold extensions at the attachment area and wash in a downward motion with sulfate-free shampoo.
        4. Conditioning: Apply conditioner from mid-lengths to ends, avoiding bonds or tape tabs. Leave on for 5-10 minutes.
        5. Rinse thoroughly with cool water.
        6. For clip-ins: Lay flat on a clean towel to air dry.
        7. For attached extensions: Apply leave-in conditioner and air dry or blow dry on cool setting.

        ## Deep Conditioning

        1. Frequency: Deep condition every 2-3 weeks to maintain moisture and prevent dryness.
        2. Application: Apply deep conditioner from mid-lengths to ends, avoiding roots/bonds.
        3. Process: Cover with a plastic cap and leave for 20-30 minutes. For enhanced results, apply gentle heat with a bonnet dryer.
        4. Rinse thoroughly with cool water.

        ## Heat Styling

        1. Always apply heat protectant before using any hot tools.
        2. Keep heat settings below 365Â°F (185Â°C).
        3. Use heat styling sparingly to extend the life of the hair.
        4. Allow hair to fully dry before using flat irons or curling wands.
        5. Avoid repeatedly styling the same sections to prevent heat damage.

        ## Coloring and Chemical Processing

        1. We recommend professional coloring for best results.
        2. Avoid bleaching hair that has been previously colored.
        3. Perform a strand test before full application.
        4. Use color-safe products after processing.
        5. Deep condition after any chemical service.
        6. Note that chemical processing will void any product warranty.

        ## Storage

        1. Store wigs on a wig stand or mannequin head.
        2. Store clip-in extensions in their original packaging or a storage case.
        3. Keep all hair products in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight.
        4. For long-term storage, place in a breathable dust bag after ensuring the hair is completely dry.
